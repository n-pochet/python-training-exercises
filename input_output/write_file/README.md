# Write File

Implement the `to_file` function in `write_file.py`

It should write to a file any object that is passed to the function.

Example:

```
>>> l = [1, '2', 3]
>>> to_file('filename', l)
```

`filename` contains now: `[1, '2', 3]`

## Run the tests

```
python write_file_tests.py
```

It should output a positive result:

```
